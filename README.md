### üòÑ About me 
I'm currently a Masters student of Data Science and Business Analytics in my second year studies at the [University of Warsaw](https://en.uw.edu.pl/)

I am passionate about digital innovation. My goal is to use the data being collected in different domains and apply Machine Learning tools and techniques to create new solutions and improve business processes.

I am also a self-taught software developer and Python enthusiast who utilizes Python Frameworks such as Django and Flask to create efficient secure web applications.
